# Simple Sponsorships
Simple Sponsorships, a WordPress plugin to accept sponsorships on your site

## Using this plugin

To use this plugin, you'll need to compile the styles and scripts. You can do that by positioning yourself in the folder and run ``npm install``. You can also run ``npm build``to create production ready styles and scripts.

## Contributing

### Reporting

You can even contribute by reporting bugs. Create an issue and describe it. Also, list the steps to reproduce the issue.

### Coding

Fork the repository, make changes, create a PR to this master branch.

The preferable workflow:

1. Create the issue (or find one in here)
2. Discuss it
3. If accepted, create a branch issue/{NUMBER OF THE ISSUE} and make changes
3. Create the PR (Pull Request) for it
4. Assign one of the core contributors to it so they can take a look at it.

## Sponsors

[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) allowed me to use their sevices to test Simple Sponsorships on various devices.
